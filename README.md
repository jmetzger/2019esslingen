## 2. Good overview of Galera Cluster (How it works) ##

## 3. Performance MaxScale 

### 3a. RTT determines tps 

Good article on performance MaxScale 

https://severalnines.com/database-blog/improve-performance-galera-cluster-mysql-or-mariadb

as is:
tps restricted by RTT (Round Trip Time)

Quote ():
"[In a Galera cluster] a given row canâ€™t be modified more than once per RTT"

Hence, transactions per second can be estimated by dividing RTT (in second) into 1 second:

Minimum tps: 1 / 0.00134 (max RTT) = 746.26 ~ 746 tps
Average tps: 1 / 0.000431 (avg RTT) = 2320.19 ~ 2320 tps
Maximum tps: 1 / 0.000111 (min RTT) = 9009.01 ~ 9009 tps

Slowest node tears performance down. 

### 3b. Transaction Size is crucial 

 - After the writeset is transferred, there will be a certification process. 
 - Certification is a process to determine whether or not the node can apply the writeset. 
 - Galera generates MD5 checksum pseudo keys from every full row. 
 - The cost of certification depends on the size of the writeset, which translates into a number of unique key lookups into the certification index (a hash table). 
 - If you update 500,000 rows in a single transaction, for example:

```
UPDATE mydb.settings SET success = 1;
```

## 4. What does gcomm mean (e.g. in gcomm://) 

Group communication 

## 5. Waht does wsrep mean ? 

Write set Replication 

## 6. Healthiness Indicator of Nodes 

```
# Show status like '%wsrep%'
wsrep_cluster_state: Primary
wsrep_local_state_comment: Synced
wsrep_ready: On
```

## 7. Schema Update (TOI / RSU) 

DDL statements (ALTER, CREATE, RENAME, TRUNCATE, DROP)

TOI (Total Order Isolation + Alternative pt-online-schema-change):
https://severalnines.com/blog/online-schema-upgrade-mysql-galera-cluster-using-toi-method

RSU (Rolling Schema Upgrade) 
```
mysql> SET SESSION wsrep_OSU_method=RSU;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE sbtest1.sbtest1 ADD INDEX idx_new (k, c); 
Query OK, 0 rows affected (5 min 19.59 sec)
```

RSU automatically switched the local node to Donor/Desynced state, to ensure it will not impact
the rest of the cluster
